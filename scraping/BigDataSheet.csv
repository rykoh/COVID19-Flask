Sentinel cells and organisms that detect and respond to infectious agents with expanding footprints in a host population or expanding host ranges are of particular interest, as the early detection of these infectious agents might have value in preventing future pandemics.

This pandemic places people with unmet health and social needs at heightened risk of infection and complications, while propagating unmet needs through job losses, school and business closures, occupational risks, and social distancing policies.

UT Austin,Janeta Zoldan,Department of Biomedical Engineering,"Assistant Professor Dr. Zoldan has developed a three-dimensional model that mimics the
growth of human vessel networks using patient-specific cells. Emerging
clinical data suggest that COVID-19 disrupts the inner lining of blood
vessels (the endothelial cells) and that this process may be one of the
events leading to mortality in severe cases. This human-based model is
ideal for studying the interactions of growing blood vessels or intact
vessel networks with COVID-19 secreted cytokines (spike proteins).
Based on these interactions, she will identify and test drug candidates
that can prevent these harmful interactions. Additionally, the use of
patient-specific cells in this model can help uncover if impaired vessel
growth is related to current COVID-19 high mortality rate in elderly
