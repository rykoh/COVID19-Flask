Defining the therapeutic potential of host-targeted approaches for combating COVID-19,Stanford, https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/shirit-einav ,"Einav’s lab is researching repurposed and novel anti-viral approaches targeting two cellular kinases that are an Achilles' heel of multiple unrelated RNA viruses. Their data show that a combination of two already-approved anti-cancer drugs that act against these kinases inhibits replication of multiple viruses in vitro and reduces mortality in mice infected with the dengue or Ebola viruses. The lab has also been developing more selective compounds that target these cellular kinases and have potent activity against multiple RNA viruses, including flaviviruses and coronaviruses, both in vitro and in human primary cells."
Coronavirus antiviral research database,Stanford, https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-shafer ,"Shafer’s team has created an online database of compounds with proven or potential anti-COVID-19 activity. The compounds include targeted anti-virals, repurposed drugs, investigational agents and other compounds that inhibit virus replication. The data come from published biochemical, cellular, small animal, nonhuman primate and human clinical studies. The goal of the database is to provide a uniform way to report experimental results, enabling comparisons between different compounds and allowing prioritization for further development."
Crowdsourcing solutions to better understand molecular structures of COVID-19,Stanford," https://profiles.stanford.edu/howard-chang 
https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/rhiju-das 
https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/howard-chang ","The Chang and Das labs are engaging participants of the online-gaming platform Eterna to understand how the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus might change during the pandemic. Eterna educates and enables its players to “be the virus,” simulating how it shifts its sequence over time to evade diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines being developed to fight COVID-19. The project seeks to provide RNA-structure-informed predictions and analyses that are not available through other computational efforts, while engaging and educating millions of citizens worldwide through compelling puzzles."
Stanford Medicine National Daily Health Survey for Coronavirus ,Stanford, https://profiles.stanford.edu/lawrence-hofmann ,"Hofmann is leading an effort to track COVID-19 symptoms nationally using self-reported data from a daily, digital survey. The goal is to create a novel coronavirus heat map that can be used to target and inform national efforts and public health interventions. The creation of this data set is dependent on participation across Stanford Medicine and our broader communities."

https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/yvonne-maldonado 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/yvonne-maldonado 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/nigam-shah ","Shah and Maldonado are hoping to better anticipate the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing predictions of the pandemic are uncertain due to many factors, such as a lack of plentiful and optimal data and the fact that models vary depending on the location. The scientists are creating a platform that combines diverse inputs to quantify the effects of the shelter-in-place order. The goal is to create more accurate, higher-resolution models about COVID-19 pandemic parameters."
Continuous symptom profiling of patients screened for SARS-CoV-2,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/nigam-shah 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/nigam-shah ","Shah’s team is analyzing medical notes describing symptoms of patients screened and tested for SARS-CoV-2 at Stanford Medicine. They want to determine if combinations of symptoms are predictive of SARS-CoV-2 test results to assist screening in low-resource settings. They also hope to use information from the medical notes — such as symptoms, duration of disease, travel history and more — to anticipate which patients will require admission or eventual ICU care."
Bed- and resource-use projections for Stanford Health Care,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/david-scheinker 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/david-scheinker

Their work encompasses diverse populations and geographies, including California, Mexico and India. The model incorporates realistic demography and patterns of contacts and disease transmissions, as well as nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing."
Predicting best strategies for scarce resource allocation during COVID-19 pandemic,Stanford," https://profiles.stanford.edu/tina-hernandez-boussard 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/manisha-desai ","Hernandez-Boussard and Desai will use data that shows the time of hospital admission up to the time of mechanical ventilation to predict patient recovery, details of hospital discharge and survival at 24 hours, 7 days, and later. This model will include important factors for COVID-19 recovery and will be continuously updated in real-time as emerging data become available. In the event of resource scarcity, this effort has the potential to inform optimal resource allocation at Stanford Health care."
COVID-19 imaging utilization per patient admission,Stanford, https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren ,Lungren and his team are building a dashboard for real-time visualization of COVID-19 radiological imaging at Stanford Hospital. The tool will aid the hospital’s resource planning by forecasting the impact of incoming patients on bed use and by predicting expected radiological image use. The team will create a web-based dashboard that will be implemented at Stanford Hospital for better radiological resource management.
Inflammatory bowel disease treatment in the time of COVID: Patient perceptions and decision-making ,Stanford," https://profiles.stanford.edu/sarah-streett 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/cindy-kin ","Kin and Streett are exploring how people with inflammatory bowel diseases, including people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis whose treatment frequently involves chronic immunosuppressive therapies, are affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The study aims to understand the primary concerns that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have about their illnesses and treatments as they relate to the COVID-19 epidemic so that physicians and the health care team can effectively engage them in shared decision-making."
Optimized remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic,Stanford, https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/pablo-paredes-castro ,"Paredes and collaborators are creating digital tools to support and maintain productivity levels while managing stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and long-term telecommuting. The researchers propose a collection of tools, dubbed “Home Sweet Office,” that can support personal productivity by managing procrastination caused by online behaviors, such as overuse of social media, and provide stress-management tactics and emotion-regulation interventions."
Rates of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/157679

https://profiles.stanford.edu/james-quinn 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/nigam-shah 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/ian-brown 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/benjamin-pinsky ","The scientists published a research letter that reports on how often patients infected with the coronavirus in Northern California are co-infected with other respiratory pathogens. Results of their analysis suggest higher rates of co-infection than previously reported, with no significant difference in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and without other pathogens. The study indicates that the presence of a non–SARS-CoV-2 pathogen does not provide reassurance that a patient isn’t also infected with SARS-CoV-2."

The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated mitigation strategies are expected to have significant psychosocial, behavioral, and socioeconomic impacts on health, which are exacerbated in populations that experience health disparities and other vulnerable groups, leading to disproportionately adverse consequences. Those experiencing health disparities prior to the COVID-19 pandemic are at increased risk of infection and other COVID-19 related consequences (e.g., job loss, unpaid leave, lost wages). Research is needed to test community interventions focused on the prevention (or slowing) of COVID-19 transmission, evaluate local and state policies and programs intended to mitigate COVID-19 exposure and improve adherence, and reduce the negative impact of the multifaceted consequences on the health of populations who experience health disparities and other vulnerable groups. This work may includeleveraging and scaling existing resources (e.g., health education materials, technology, social media, mass media, social support networks, social services). In domains and populations in which the evidence base is limited, the development, testing, and implementation of novel or adapted interventions to address the negative health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the unintended health consequences of population-level interventions) may also be needed to address the unique needs of populations. See guidelines for research objectives."

This Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) highlights interest in research to strengthen the healthcare response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to future public health emergencies, including pandemics. While the direct clinical effects of COVID-19 are supported by other funding opportunities, the purpose of this NOSI is to support research to address secondary health effects of the social, behavioral, and economic changes, particularly among populations who experience health disparities and vulnerable populations through the use of digital health assessments and interventions to yield measurable near-term impact. In order to significantly improve near term impact of treatment and identification of individuals at risk for, or experiencing worsening health secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic across the full lifespan, supplements will focus particularly on NIH-designated health disparity (racial/ethnic minorities, less privileged socioeconomic status, rural residents and sexual and gender minorities) and other populations with medical or social vulnerabilities. The latter include residents of chronic care facilities, community-dwelling older adults, pregnant women, children, individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia, homeless, and those incarcerated or involved with the criminal justice system, individuals with substance use disorder or severe mental illness, those who are deaf or with visual, hearing, communication, or mobility impairment, and uninsured individuals.

National Science Foundation (NSF),Virginia Tech,No links but here is the point of contact: manth@austin.utexas.edu,"With this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), we highlight the interest of existing programs in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) in interdisciplinary research for the development of novel biological platforms that are capable of sensing and responding to emerging infectious agents. The mechanism of sensing should be adaptable and or evolvable such that the sentinel cells, or other appropriate biotechnology solutions, are robust to a range of emergent threats, and/or can easily be reprogrammed and deployed once a new threat is identified. The platform's response should be one or more of the following: alert the user, destroy the threat, protect the host, initiate an immune response or other strategies that would ensure mitigation of the threat. Sentinel cells and organisms that detect and respond to infectious agents with expanding footprints in a host population or expanding host ranges are of particular interest, as the early detection of these infectious agents might have value in preventing future pandemics. In addition, fundamental science and technology that would lead to the development of the envisioned sentinel cells and organisms are also of interest. Investigators are encouraged not to be limited in their approach, but to think broadly about innovations leveraging biology and engineering to advance adaptable detection of emerging biological threats."
