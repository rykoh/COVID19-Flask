Track COVID study,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/yvonne-maldonado 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/yvonne-maldonado ","Researchers at Stanford, UC-San Francisco and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub have begun a study to track changes in San Francisco Bay Area SARS-CoV-2 infection rates over a nine-month period. The participants will receive monthly diagnostic tests to identify current infection and serological tests to determine previous infection. Researchers are also sequencing the viral genomes from all participants who test positive to help understand how the virus has spread and whether co-infections with other viruses play a role in the illness. The study is being led by Maldonado at Stanford and George Rutherford, MD, at UC-San Francisco."
Building COVID-19 testing capacity both locally and nationally,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/benjamin-pinsky 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/benjamin-pinsky ","Pinsky’s team is focused on building COVID-19 testing capacity, both locally and nationally. They are collaborating with other clinical laboratories to ensure these labs can meet the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for COVID-19 clinical testing. The group is also working with various collaborators to develop and evaluate novel methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as methods to assess immune protection and to predict the severity of disease."
Machine-learning-based evaluation for COVID-19,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/niaz-banaei 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/niaz-banaei ","Banaei’s group is using machine learning to develop a web tool that uses non-SARS-CoV-2 test results (such as blood cell counts and other available tests) to rule out COVID-19 infection with high accuracy. The goal is to provide health care workers another, possibly faster, option for screening individuals for COVID-19."
Natural history of shedding and household transmission of COVID-19: Constructing patterns of viral spread and evolution,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/yvonne-maldonado 
https://profiles.stanford.edu/yvonne-maldonado ","Maldonado’s team will combine genomic and epidemiologic data to address questions about the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19. Her team plans to use whole-genome sequencing to understand how COVID-19 mutates during the early stages of infection, as well as generate a bio-repository of specimens and associated clinical and epidemiologic data for use in understanding the transmission of COVID-19.

They also plan to share survey results to directly inform public health practitioners, health care systems, clinicians and policymakers about the informational, social and health needs of community members in their regions."
Utilizing radiological imaging of COVID-19 patients for allocation of hospital resources,Stanford, https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren ,"Lungren and his collaborators are using machine learning to analyze CT scans, X-rays and clinical data of COVID-positive patients to predict the risk of respiratory failure or the need for supportive treatment. Their goal is to help direct the allocation of hospital resources, including decision-making on admission and use of intensive care resources."
Analysis of COVID-19 CT scans and X-rays for classification and prediction of patient outcomes,Stanford, https://profiles.stanford.edu/matthew-lungren ,"Lungren and his collaborators are using imaging and clinical data to predict the risk of respiratory failure, mortality and length of hospital admission among patients with COVID-19. In addition, they aim to quantify CT scans of COVID 19 patients and auto-generate medical reports and correlate the scans to clinical outcomes, such as infection. "

Kuo and Amieva are investigating details behind how the virus infects human lung and intestinal tissues through organoid models, and Blish is studying the response of individual cells infected with SARS-CoV-2."
Multi-omics assessment of individuals infected with COVID-19,Stanford," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/michael-snyder
