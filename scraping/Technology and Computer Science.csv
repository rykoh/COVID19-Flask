The NIH Director's Early Independence Award (a component of the High-Risk, High-Reward Research program of the NIH Common Fund) provides an opportunity for exceptional junior scientists to accelerate their entry into an independent research career by forgoing the traditional post-doctoral training period. Though most newly graduated doctoral-level researchers would benefit from post-doctoral training, a small number of outstanding junior investigators are capable of launching directly into an independent research career. For those select junior investigators who have already established a record of scientific innovation and research productivity and have demonstrated unusual scientific vision and maturity, typical post-doctoral training would unnecessarily delay their entry into independent research. Due to the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Common Fund will dedicate funds provided by the CARES Act to support a total of 5-10 Early Independence Awards (through this FOA) or Transformative Research Awards (through RFA-RM-20-020) that bring new, innovative perspectives and approaches to the prevention of, preparation for, or response to coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, domestically or internationally.

National Science Foundation (NSF),Virginia Tech,https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-20-020.html,"With this Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), the National Science Foundation (NSF) wishes to notify the community that research projects focused on pandemics are considered appropriate for the Civic Innovation Challenge (CIVIC; NSF 20-562), a research and action competition in the smart and connected communities (S&CC) domain. CIVIC is organized as a two-stage competition with two tracks. One track is centered onresilience to natural disasters and calls for research that equips communities with greater preparedness and resilience to natural disasters. The other track is centered on communities and mobility and calls for research that addresses better mobility options to solve the spatial mismatch between housing affordability and jobs, as well as associated mobility solutions thatcan increase access to critical services and amenities that foster healthy and thriving communities. While CIVIC was planned long in advance of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, today the world is focused on this pandemic. Given this reality, NSF is notifying the community of its interest in pandemics as an example of a disaster pursuant to the resilience track or as a possible consideration in framing the focus of the mobility track."

The need to identify successful system alignment strategies has become increasingly urgent in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic that causes COVID-19. This pandemic places people with unmet health and social needs at heightened risk of infection and complications, while propagating unmet needs through job losses, school and business closures, occupational risks, and social distancing policies. This call for proposals (CFP) will provide supplemental research funding to teams that are already engaged in the study of a promising system alignment mechanism, with the objective of learning how this mechanism performs in addressing health and social needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible teams must have an active or recently completed research study (within 12 months of application submission) that can be extended through the use of supplemental research funding. This CFP is appropriate for studying an existing system alignment mechanism implemented prior to the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, and about which some pre-COVID evidence has already been created by the applicant. Studies funded through the S4A program must test a specific system alignment mechanism that engages all three of the sectors referenced in this call—medical care, public health, and social services."

Jon Huibregtse,UT Austin,https://covid19research.ssrc.org/rapid-response-grants-on-covid-19-and-the-social-sciences/,"Professor Dr. Huibregtse submitted a manuscript to Molecular Cell, showing that the SARS-CoV-
2/COVID-19 virus encodes a protease that counteracts the activity of the cellular
ISG15 anti-viral protein. This result establishes the viral protease (PLpro) as a drug
target for antiviral therapy. Further, the Mol. Cell paper proposes that a consequence
of PLpro de-ISGylase activity is the stimulation of a pro-inflammatory ""cytokine storm"".
COVID-19 patients die largely as a result of cytokine storms, and his results suggest a
clear route toward inhibiting the cytokine storm that is initiated as a result of PLpro
activity. Further, following submission of the Mol. Cell paper, he identified an FDA-
approved drug that inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protease. The molecule blocks its
ability to act on ISG15 conjugates and we have strong preliminary evidence that this

collaboration with LungTherapeutics, a local company that is planning to start testing
LTI-03 for treating virus-induced lung injury in a mouse model. The outcome of thecurrent experiment would provide important data and rational for the continuation ofr e s e a r c h   i n t o   L T I - 0 3   a s   a   p o t e n t i a l   C O V I D - 1 9   t h e r a p e u t i c ."
Bo Xie,UT Austin,No links but here is the point of contact: sparekh@utexas.edu,"Professor Dr. Xie and collegues recently submitted an opinion paper* on global health
crises accepted for publication in JASIST, a top journal in information science.
A few years ago, Dr. Xie received an NSF grant to study clinicians' information
wants during the Ebola crisis, and published the findings. This time around,
she wants to move further, to see her research findings translate into
something that makes a real difference outside of academia. She is a Co-PI
with Dr. Ken Fleischmann on a recently funded NSF RAPID grant that
examines trust in public health information during the COVID-19 pandemic.
