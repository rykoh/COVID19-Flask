Role of antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease ,"Taia Wang, MD, PhD","Wang and her group are studying molecules that correlate with immunity against COVID-19. Their studies focus on defining a protective antibody response, and they will investigate whether antibodies have a role in determining the severity of COVID-19. The overarching goal of this work is to guide the development of vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.", https://profiles.stanford.edu/taia-wang ,Technology and Computer Science
Comparative pathology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 infections in humans and animal models,"Garry Nolan, PhD; David McIlwain, PhD; Sizun Jiang, PhD; Brice Gaudilliere, MD, PhD; and other collaborators",Nolan and his team are applying multiplexed technologies to achieve in-depth profiling of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in nonclinical and clinical studies. Their goal is to identify immune markers associated with outcomes for COVID-19 and understand the arrangement of immune cells relative to lung tissue cells during infection.," https://profiles.stanford.edu/sizun-jiang

Inflammatory bowel disease treatment in the time of COVID: Patient perceptions and decision-making ,"Cindy Kin, MD; Elizabeth Shelton; Kreeti Shankar; and Sarah Streett, MD","Kin and Streett are exploring how people with inflammatory bowel diseases, including people with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis whose treatment frequently involves chronic immunosuppressive therapies, are affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The study aims to understand the primary concerns that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases have about their illnesses and treatments as they relate to the COVID-19 epidemic so that physicians and the health care team can effectively engage them in shared decision-making."," https://profiles.stanford.edu/sarah-streett

SARS-CoV-2 tissue specificity and its role in progression to multi-organ failure,"Scott Boyd, MD, PhD, and Sandra Abel Nielsen, PhD","An increasing number of reports show the association of COVID-19 deaths with cardiac injury, cardiac arrest, arrhythmias and likely myocarditis. It is largely unclear if these serious and sometimes fatal conditions are due to direct SARS-CoV-2 influence, immunological responses or complications from existing cardiovascular disorders. Through this project, Boyd, Nielsen and their team aim to investigate which tissues support the growth of SARS-CoV-2. They will also analyze the local tissue B-cell-mediated immune responses in COVID-19 to assess for antibody responses contributing to tissue pathology.", https://profiles.stanford.edu/scott-boyd ,Technology and Computer Science
SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular complications,"Sean Wu, MD;  Patricia Nguyen, MD;  Catherine Blish, MD, PhD, and Jan Carette, PhD",Wu and Nguyen are researching cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. The scientists are addressing the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection in heart muscle and vascular cells and the consequences of taking common drugs for high blood pressure. Their research employs muscle and vascular cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells to determine how these blood pressure drugs affect the virus’ ability to enter cells. ," https://profiles.stanford.edu/catherine-blish

Informal caregivers are family members or friends who provide significant help to people with mental or physical health conditions. Trivedi aims to use the results of the survey to guide advocacy efforts in support of informal caregivers.

Gastrointestinal manifestations in SARS-CoV-2,"George Cholankeril, MD; Alexander Podboy, MD; and Aijaz Ahmed, MD","Cholankeril, Podboy and Ahmed aim to characterize the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly one-third of patients in their study had gastrointestinal symptoms while infected with SARS-CoV-2. The team also saw mild elevations in liver enzymes in some patients, which may correlate with a need for a higher level of care. The group is continuing to investigate if gastrointestinal symptoms and liver enzyme abnormalities at presentation could be associated with increased severity of illness, requiring an escalation of care or higher rate of health care utilization."," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/alexander-podboy

Rates of co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens,"David Kim, MD, PhD; James Quinn, MD; Benjamin Pinsky, MD, PhD; Nigam Shah, PhD; and Ian Brown, MD","The scientists published a research letter that reports on how often patients infected with the coronavirus in Northern California are co-infected with other respiratory pathogens. Results of their analysis suggest higher rates of co-infection than previously reported, with no significant difference in rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with and without other pathogens. The study indicates that the presence of a non–SARS-CoV-2 pathogen does not provide reassurance that a patient isn’t also infected with SARS-CoV-2."," https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/157679
